    "Using the given dataset, we analysed the number of WNV cases in Chicago, the clustering traps for mosquito, location of the pesticide spraying, the impact of pesticide spraying vs the WNV outbreak, location with high mosquito count and WNV cluster and effect of weather on the number of mosquito and WNV. Based on our findings, we discovered some useful insights about how the features contributed to the outbreak of West Nile Virus (WNV).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instant, the feature 'month' gives a significant indicator in relationship with the number of WNV cases which indicated that the highest numbers of WNV present mostly appeared during the month of July, August and September. This could be due to July to September being the summer period for Chicago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the scores returned from Pycaret, the best model is Light Gradient Boosting Machine with highest AUC score 0.8260. The higher the AUC score, the better the model's performance at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Further Research\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest to expand the study to other states and establish better insight on the number of mosquitos caught per trap, the life cycles of the mosquito and the weather pattern as to how, when and where to get a better predict target spraying model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Better Adoption\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite of spraying the pesticide, the best way to prevent WNV disease is to reduce the number of mosquitos around the home and to take personal precautions to avoid mosquito bites. Precautions include:\n",
    "  * change water in vases/bowls on alternate days\n",
    "  * turn over all water storage containers\n",
    "  * remove water from flower pot plates on alternate days\n",
    "  * cover bamboo pole holders when not in use.\n",
    "  * clear blockages and put BTI insecticide in roof gutters monthly\n",
    "  * spray insecticide in the dark corner around the house\n",
    "  * apply insect repellent and wear covered clothes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Drone used in mosquito control\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommend the use of drones in mosquito control with surveillance of nuisance mosquitos and potential vectors of pathogens. The insecticide application using drone to conduct surveillance and control in remote areas that are difficult to reach have been carried out by the GDG drone under the nuisance-reduction programme. The project was completed to nearly one thousand hectares of area producing mosquito larvae.\n",
