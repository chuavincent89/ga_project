    "With the evolving of the internet and popularity in using credit card for payments, numbers of credit card fraud has been increased as compared to old days. Although there is very low crime rate in Singapore, there is still credit card fraud cases happens and it affect the credit card users as well as the bank who provide the credit card facilities.\n",

    "Nowadays, the news about credit card fraud transactions may getting more frequently that both regulators and public getting more cautions and seriously look into it. According to [Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/460-jump-in-unauthorised-online-banking-and-card-transactions-in-2020), there were 1,848 police reports of such transactions involving criminals phishing for banking and card details from victims - up 462 per cent from 2019's 329 cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Banks have taken up precautionary actions by implementing stringent SMS one-time passwords (OTP) requirements as well as sending transaction alerts to the user in order to prevent credit card fraud to happens. However, with the evolving in technologies fraudsters will keep come up with new ways to commit credit card fraud, hence we have to keep on modify and improve our detection model in order to detect credit card fraud as accurate as possible along the way."

    "One of the main business of the bank is to provide Credit Card facility for the clients. However, Credit Card Fraud Cases does not seems to decrease along with the evolving of technologies these years. It has caused significant losses and negative impact to the clients as well as the bank. For clients, not every credit card fraud transactions have been realized on time or there are clients who do not aware of the fraud transactions occurred as the amount of the fraud transactions are too little to be realized. Hence these group of clients may not raise the discrepancies on time for the bank the to investigate and reimburse the losses. Most of the time if the bank's investigation outcome is a fraud transaction, the bank has to reimburse the clients and it causes the bank suffer losses. On top of that, clients may also lose confident on the bank's products and it will further causes the reputational loses to the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "With above, Risk and Compliance department has approached me who is a data scientist of the bank to build an effective __Fraud Detection Model__ which able to classify the fraud transactions accurately. I have been provided with 1.3m of training datasets and 550k testing datasets with transactions from duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants. I will also need to __identify the top predictors and features__ that used to detect the credit card fraud transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having the fraud detection model, the team will be able to identify the fraud transaction right immediately when it being detected. It will reduce the bank's losses incurred in credit card fraud transaction, gain the reputation on non-compromise security risk and clients will not be the victims of the fraud transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to build the fraud detection classification model by exploring the classification algorithms, for example `LogisticRegression`, `GaussianNaiveBayes`,`RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBClassifier` and `CatBoostClassifier`. I will also conduct the __*Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) Analysis for customer segmentation*__ and __*build a Tableau Dashboard to visualize the predicted outcome from test dataset*__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets provided is a super imbalanced in class which only 0.58% of data are labelled as fraud transactions, which means that high accuracy will not be the metric suitable in evaluating this datasets. I will need to have high True Positive outcome with minimal False Negative (Predicted not fraud, but is true fraud) and False Positive (Predicted is fraud, but is not fraud). In this case, my priority metrics to evaluate success of my model is to have __High Recall score__ and __High F1 Score__ which balance it with __Precision Score__. Specifically with the score above 90%. My model have to be able to capture as high numbers of fraud transactions as possible, and it allow minimal of Type I error (False Positive), this is because too many of Type I error may cause unnecessary alert triggered to clients as well as creating inconveniences."
